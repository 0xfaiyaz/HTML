          The Pink City of Jaipur is the capital of Rajasthan and one of India’s
          most alluring destinations. The city’s palaces, forts, and markets make
          it a favorite among travelers. The main attraction is the City Palace,
          which is a blend of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture. The palace is
          still home to the last ruling royal family, who live in a private
          section of the palace. The Jantar Mantar Observatory is another
          must-see in Jaipur. The UNESCO World Heritage site is home to 19
          architectural astronomical instruments, which were built by the Rajput
          king Sawai Jai Singh, who founded Jaipur in 1727.
